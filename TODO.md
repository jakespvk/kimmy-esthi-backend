# TODO.md
- "please note, your appointment slot is not booked until a Zelle has been received @xxxxx"
- Make calendar bigger, take up more of the page
- Integrate Google business somehow, + info about locations, hours
- Policies page dedicated?
- Notifications for appointment requests (via email? smtp server?)
- For admin panel, creating appointments: have time picker, with add button to add another time,
then multiple select dates and apply all the times to all the dates selected. This seems like the
smoothest UX
